Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Nate Suri, a full stack web developer and filmmaker, and I'm currently looking for full time
and freelance developer work.

This portfolio showcases my dev projects, which you can see in the projects tab of the site.

In these projects I've leveraged a variety of languages and frameworks, including `JS`, `HTML/CSS`, `React`, `Express`, `Ruby on Rails`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Heroku`. I've also dabbled in `Elixir` and `Python`, and I'm currently learning the AWS tools `EC2` and `S3`.

I also designed and developed the portfolio, and I'm currently refactoring it to move away from `bootstrap` an use custom components.
